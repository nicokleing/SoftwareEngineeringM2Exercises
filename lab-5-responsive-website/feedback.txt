position: absolute is used a lot in this website, and it's causing issues with different screen sizes
(like some buttons disappear or some text is invisible, etc.)

position: absolute is used sparingly as it's better to get the browser to handle the document
layout flow in a lot of cases. Using position: absolute requires us to tell the browser
exactly where to put the element, and that can change depending on screen sizes, font sizes,
how zoomed in the screen is, etc. It would be a lot easier to change this website to use
something like flexbox instead.
